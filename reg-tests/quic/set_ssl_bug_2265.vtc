#REGTEST_TYPE=devel

# This reg-test uses the "set ssl cert" command to update a certificate over the CLI.
# It requires socat to upload the certificate
#
# this check does 3 requests, the first one will use "www.test1.com" as SNI,
# the second one with the same but that must fail and the third one will use
# "localhost". Since vtest can't do SSL, we use haproxy as an SSL client with 2
# chained listen section.
#
# This is the same as "set_ssl_cert_noext.vtc" but the .crt contains both the certificate and the key.
#
# If this test does not work anymore:
# - Check that you have socat
