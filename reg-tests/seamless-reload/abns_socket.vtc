# commit b4dd15b
# BUG/MINOR: unix: Make sure we can transfer abns sockets on seamless reload.
#
# When checking if a socket we got from the parent is suitable for a listener,
# we just checked that the path matched sockname.tmp, however this is
# unsuitable for abns sockets, where we don't have to create a temporary
# file and rename it later.
# To detect that, check that the first character of the sun_path is 0 for
# both, and if so, that &sun_path[1] is the same too.
#
# Note: there are some tricks here. One of them is that we must not bind the
# same abns address to multiple processes that may run in parallel. Since
# vtest cannot provide abns sockets, we're instead concatenating the number
# of the listening port that vtest allocated for another frontend to the abns
# path, which guarantees to make them unique in the system.
