/* Administrative status : a server runs in one of these 3 stats :
 *   - READY : normal mode
 *   - DRAIN : takes no new visitor, equivalent to weight == 0
 *   - MAINT : maintenance mode, no more traffic nor health checks.
 *
 * Each server may be in maintenance by itself or may inherit this status from
 * another server it tracks. It can also be in drain mode by itself or inherit
 * it from another server. Let's store these origins here as flags. These flags
 * are combined this way :
 *
 *      FMAINT  IMAINT  FDRAIN  IDRAIN  Resulting state
 *         0       0       0       0    READY

 *         0       1       x       x    MAINT
 *         1       x       x       x    MAINT
 *
 * This can be simplified this way :
 *
 *   state_str = (state & MAINT) ? "MAINT" : (state & DRAIN) : "DRAIN" : "READY"
