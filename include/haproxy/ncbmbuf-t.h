/* Non-contiguous bitmap buffer
 *
 * This module is an alternative implementation to ncbuf type. Its main
 * difference is that filled blocks and gaps are encoded via a bitmap.
 *
 * The main advantage of the bitmap is that contrary to ncbuf type there is no
 * limitation on the minimal size of gaps. Thus, operation such as add and
 * advance are guaranteed to succeed.
 *
 * Storage is reserved for the bitmap at the end of the buffer area,
 * representing roughly 1/9 of the total space. Thus, usable buffer storage is
 * smaller than the default ncbuf type.
