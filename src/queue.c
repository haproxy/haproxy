/* Short explanation on the locking, which is far from being trivial : a
 * pendconn is a list element which necessarily is associated with an existing
 * stream. It has pendconn->strm always valid. A pendconn may only be in one of
 * these three states :
 *   - unlinked : in this case it is an empty list head ;
 *   - linked into the server's queue ;
 *   - linked into the proxy's queue.
 *
 * A stream does not necessarily have such a pendconn. Thus the pendconn is
 * designated by the stream->pend_pos pointer. This results in some properties :
 *   - pendconn->strm->pend_pos is never NULL for any valid pendconn
 *   - if p->node.node.leaf_p is NULL, the element is unlinked,
 *     otherwise it necessarily belongs to one of the other lists ; this may
 *     not be atomically checked under threads though ;
 *   - pendconn->px is never NULL if pendconn->list is not empty
 *   - pendconn->srv is never NULL if pendconn->list is in the server's queue,
 *     and is always NULL if pendconn->list is in the backend's queue or empty.
 *   - pendconn->target is NULL while the element is queued, and points to the
 *     assigned server when the pendconn is picked.
 *
 * Threads complicate the design a little bit but rules remain simple :
 *   - the server's queue lock must be held at least when manipulating the
 *     server's queue, which is when adding a pendconn to the queue and when
 *     removing a pendconn from the queue. It protects the queue's integrity.
 *
 *   - the proxy's queue lock must be held at least when manipulating the
 *     proxy's queue, which is when adding a pendconn to the queue and when
 *     removing a pendconn from the queue. It protects the queue's integrity.
 *
 *   - both locks are compatible and may be held at the same time.
 *
 *   - a pendconn_add() is only performed by the stream which will own the
 *     pendconn ; the pendconn is allocated at this moment and returned ; it is
 *     added to either the server or the proxy's queue while holding this
s *     queue's lock.
 *
 *   - the pendconn is then met by a thread walking over the proxy or server's
 *     queue with the respective lock held. This lock is exclusive and the
 *     pendconn can only appear in one queue so by definition a single thread
 *     may find this pendconn at a time.
 *
 *   - the pendconn is unlinked either by its own stream upon success/abort/
 *     free, or by another one offering it its server slot. This is achieved by
 *     pendconn_process_next_strm() under either the server or proxy's lock,
 *     pendconn_redistribute() under the server's lock, pendconn_grab_from_px()
 *     under the proxy's lock, or pendconn_unlink() under either the proxy's or
 *     the server's lock depending on the queue the pendconn is attached to.
 *
 *   - no single operation except the pendconn initialisation prior to the
 *     insertion are performed without eithre a queue lock held or the element
 *     being unlinked and visible exclusively to its stream.
 *
 *   - pendconn_grab_from_px() and pendconn_process_next_strm() assign ->target
 *     so that the stream knows what server to work with (via
 *     pendconn_dequeue() which sets it on strm->target).
 *
 *   - a pendconn doesn't switch between queues, it stays where it is.
