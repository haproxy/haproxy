------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please note that at this time, HAProxy Peers Protocol dissection is not supported
on Windows systems (could not be tested).

1) File list
-------------
 - packet-happp.c: source code for HAProxy Peers Protocol (HAPPP) dissection
   support.
 - wireshark.happp.dissector.patch: a patch file for wireshark sources to enable HAPPP
   dissection support. Note that this patch file modifies only two files:
   (epan/dissectors/CMakeLists.txt and epan/dissectors/Makefile.am) to add
   packet-happp.c file DISSECTOR_SRC variable which list all wireshark
 - README: this file.

 - Download wireshark sources:
   $ git clone https://code.wireshark.org/review/wireshark
 - copy packet-happp.c file to epan/dissectors/ directory.
 - apply wireshark.happp.dissector.patch file to wireshark source directory.
 - build wireshark (see https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/):
