               | HAProxy regression testing with vtest |
               +---------------------------------------+


The information found in this file are a short starting guide to help you to
write VTC (Varnish Test Case) scripts (or VTC files) for haproxy regression testing.
Such VTC files are currently used to test Varnish cache application developed by
Poul-Henning Kamp. A very big thanks you to him for having helped you to add
our haproxy C modules to vtest tool. Note that vtest was formally developed for
varnish cache reg testing and was named varnishtest. vtest is an haproxy specific
version of varnishtest program which reuses the non varnish cache specific code.

A lot of general information about how to write VTC files may be found in 'man/vtc.7'
manual of varnish cache sources directory or directly on the web here:

    https://varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/reference/vtc.html

It is *highly* recommended to read this manual before asking to haproxy ML. This
documentation only deals with the vtest support for haproxy.


vtest installation
------------------------

To use vtest you will have to download and compile the recent vtest
sources found at https://github.com/vtest/VTest.

To compile vtest:

    $ cd VTest
    $ make vtest

Note that varnishtest may be also compiled but not without the varnish cache
sources already compiled:

    $ VARNISH_SRC=<...> make varnishtest

After having compiled these sources, the vtest executable location is at the
root of the vtest sources directory.


vtest execution
---------------------

vtest is able to search for the haproxy executable file it is supposed to
launch thanks to the PATH environment variable. To force the executable to be used by
vtest, the HAPROXY_PROGRAM environment variable for vtest may be
typically set as follows:

     $ HAPROXY_PROGRAM=~/srcs/haproxy/haproxy vtest ...

vtest program comes with interesting options. The most interesting are:

    -t  Timeout in seconds to abort the test if some launched program
    -v  By default, vtest does not dump the outputs of processus it launched
        when the test passes. With this option the outputs are dumped even
        when the test passes.
    -L  to always keep the temporary VTC directories.
    -l  to keep the temporary VTC directories only when the test fails.

About haproxy, when launched by vtest, -d option is enabled by default.


How to write VTC files
----------------------

A VTC file must start with a "varnishtest" or "vtest" command line followed by a
descriptive line enclosed by double quotes. This is not specific to the VTC files
for haproxy.

The VTC files for haproxy must also contain a "feature ignore_unknown_macro" line
if any macro is used for haproxy in this file. This is due to the fact that
vtest parser code for haproxy commands generates macros the vtest
parser code for varnish cache has no knowledge of. This line prevents vtest from
failing in such cases. As a "cli" macro automatically generated, this
"feature ignore_unknown_macro" is mandatory for each VTC file for haproxy.

To make vtest capable of testing haproxy, two new VTC commands have been
implemented: "haproxy" and "syslog". "haproxy" is used to start haproxy processus.
"syslog" is used to start syslog servers (at this time, only used by haproxy).

As haproxy cannot work without configuration file, a VTC file for haproxy must
embed the configuration files contents for the haproxy instances it declares.
This may  be done using the following intuitive syntax construction: -conf {...}.
Here -conf is an argument of "haproxy" VTC command to declare the configuration
file of the haproxy instances it also declares (see "Basic HAProxy test" VTC file
below).

As for varnish VTC files, the parser of VTC files for haproxy automatically
generates macros for the declared frontends to be reused by the clients later
in the script, so after having written the "haproxy" command sections.
The syntax "fd@${my_frontend_fd_name}" must be used to bind the frontend
listeners to localhost address and random ports (see "Environment variables"
section of haproxy documentation). This is mandatory.

Each time the haproxy command parser finds a "fd@${xyz}" string in a 'ABC'
"haproxy" command section, it generates three macros: 'ABC_xyz_addr', 'ABC_xyz_port'
and 'ABC_xyz_sock', with 'ABC_xyz_sock' being resolved as 'ABC_xyz_addr
ABC_xyz_port' typically used by clients -connect parameter.

Each haproxy instance works in their own temporary working directories located
at '/tmp/vtc.<varnitest PID>.XXXXXXXX/<haproxy_instance_name>' (with XXXXXXXX
a random 8 digits hexadecimal integer. This is in this temporary directory that
the configuration file is temporarily written.

A 'stats.sock' UNIX socket is also created in this directory. There is no need
to declare such stats sockets in the -conf {...} section. The name of the parent
directory of the haproxy instances working directories is stored in 'tmpdir'. In
fact this is the working directory of the current vtest processus.

There also exists 'testdir' macro which is the parent directory of the VTC file.
It may be useful to use other files located in the same directory than the current
VTC file.



VTC file examples
-----------------

The following first VTC file is a real regression test case file for a bug which has
been fixed by 84c844e commit. We declare a basic configuration for a 'h1' haproxy
instance.

    varnishtest "SPOE bug: missing configuration file"

    #commit 84c844eb12b250aa86f2aadaff77c42dfc3cb619
    #Author: Christopher Faulet <cfaulet@haproxy.com>
    #Date:   Fri Mar 23 14:37:14 2018 +0100

    #   BUG/MINOR: spoe: Initialize variables used during conf parsing before any check

    #   Some initializations must be done at the beginning of parse_spoe_flt to avoid
    #   segmentation fault when first errors are caught, when the "filter spoe" line is
    #   parsed.

    haproxy h1 -conf-BAD {} {
      defaults
          timeout connect 5000ms
          timeout client 50000ms
          timeout server 50000ms

      frontend my-front
          filter spoe
    }


-conf-BAD haproxy command argument is used. Its role it to launch haproxy with
-c option (configuration file checking) and check that 'h1' exit(3) with 1 as
status. Here is the output when running this VTC file:

The following VTC file does almost nothing except running a shell to list
the contents of 'tmpdir' directory after having launched a haproxy instance
and 's1' HTTP server. This shell also prints the content of 'cfg' 'h1' configuration
file.

    varnishtest "List the contents of 'tmpdir'"
    feature ignore_unknown_macro

    server s1 {
    } -start

    haproxy h1 -conf {

The following example illustrate how to run a basic HTTP transaction between 'c1'
client and 's1' server with 'http1' as haproxy frontend. This frontend listen
on TCP socket with 'my_frontend_fd' as file descriptor.

    # Mandatory line
    varnishtest "Basic HAproxy test"

    # As some macros for haproxy are used in this file, this line is mandatory.
    feature ignore_unknown_macro

    server s1 {
      rxreq
      txresp -body "s1 >>> Hello world!"
    } -start

    haproxy h1 -conf {
      # Configuration file of 'h1' haproxy instance.
      defaults
        mode   http
        timeout connect         5s
        timeout server          30s
        timeout client          30s

      backend be1
        # declare 'srv1' server to point to 's1' server instance declare above.
        server srv1 ${s1_addr}:${s1_port}

      frontend http1
        use_backend be1
        bind "fd@${my_frontend_fd}"
    } -start

    client c1 -connect ${h1_my_frontend_fd_sock} {
      txreq -url "/"
      rxresp
      expect resp.status == 200
      expect resp.body == "s1 >>> Hello world!"
    } -run


It is possible to shorten the previous VTC file haproxy command section as follows:

    haproxy h1 -conf {
      # Configuration file of 'h1' haproxy instance.
      defaults
        mode   http
        timeout connect         5s
        timeout server          30s
        timeout client          30s
	}

In this latter example, "backend" and "frontend" sections are automatically
generated depending on the declarations of server instances.


Another interesting real regression test case is the following: we declare one
server 's1', a syslog server 'Slg_1' and a basic haproxy configuration for 'h1'
haproxy instance. Here we want to check that the syslog message are correctly
formatted thanks to "expect" "syslog" command (see syslog Slg_1 {...} command)
below.

    #    BUG/MINOR: log: pin the front connection when front ip/ports are logged
    #
    #    Mathias Weiersmueller reported an interesting issue with logs which Lukas
    #    diagnosed as dating back from commit 9b061e332 (1.5-dev9). When front
    #    connection information (ip, port) are logged in TCP mode and the log is
    #    emitted at the end of the connection (eg: because %B or any log tag
    #    requiring LW_BYTES is set), the log is emitted after the connection is
    #    closed, so the address and ports cannot be retrieved anymore.
    #
    #    It could be argued that we'd make a special case of these to immediately
    #    retrieve the source and destination addresses from the connection, but it
    #    seems cleaner to simply pin the front connection, marking it "tracked" by
    #    adding the LW_XPRT flag to mention that we'll need some of these elements
    #    at the last moment. Only LW_FRTIP and LW_CLIP are affected. Note that after
    #    this change, LW_FRTIP could simply be removed as it's not used anywhere.

    #    Note that the problem doesn't happen when using %[src] or %[dst] since
    #    all sample expressions set LW_XPRT.

This test does not pass without the bug fix of d02286d commit. Indeed the third syslog
message received by 'Slg_1' syslog server does not match the regular expression
of the "syslog" "expect" command:

    expect ~ \"dip\":\"${h1_fe_1_addr}\",\"dport\":\"${h1_fe_1_port}.*\"ts\":\"cD\",\"

(the IP address and port are missing), contrary to what happens with the correct bug fix:
