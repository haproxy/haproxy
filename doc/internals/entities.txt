1) Definitions
--------------

Listener
--------

A listener is the entity which is part of a frontend and which accepts
connections. There are as many listeners as there are ip:port couples.
There is at least one listener instanciated for each "bind" entry, and
port ranges will lead to as many listeners as there are ports in the
range. A listener just has a listening file descriptor ready to accept
incoming connections and to dispatch them to upper layers.


Initiator
---------

An initiator is instanciated for each incoming connection on a listener. It may
also be instanciated by a task pretending to be a client. An initiator calls
the next stage's accept() callback to present it with the parameters of the
incoming connection.


Session
-------

A session is the only entity located between an initiator and a connector.
This is the last stage which offers an accept() callback, and all of its
processing will continue with the next stage's connect() callback. It holds
the buffers needed to forward the protocol data between each side. This entity
sees the native protocol, and is able to call analysers on these buffers. As it
is used in both directions, it always has two buffers.

When transformations are required, some of them may be done on the initiator
side and other ones on the connector side. If additional buffers are needed for
such transforms, those buffers cannot replace the session's buffers, but they
may complete them.

A session only needs to be instanciated when forwarding of data is required
between two sides. Accepting and filtering on layer 4 information only does not
require a session.

For instance, let's consider the case of a proxy which receives and decodes
HTTPS traffic, processes it as HTTP and recodes it as HTTPS before forwarding
it. We'd have 3 layers of buffers, where the middle ones are used for
forwarding of the protocol data (HTTP here) :

            <-- ssl dec --> <-forwarding-> <-- ssl enc -->

              ,->[||||]--.   ,->[||||]--.   ,->[||||]--.
   client  (|)            (|)            (|)            (|)  server
              ^--[||||]<-'   ^--[||||]<-'   ^--[||||]<-'

                  HTTPS          HTTP          HTTPS

The session handling code is only responsible for monitoring the forwarding
buffers here. It may declare the end of the session once those buffers are
closed and no analyser wants to re-open them. The session is also the entity
which applies the load balancing algorithm and decides the server to use.

The other sides are responsible for propagating the state up to the session
which takes decisions.


Connector
---------

A connector is the entity which permits to instanciate a connection to a known
destination. It presents a connect() callback, and as such appears on the right
side of diagrams.


Connection
----------

A connection is the entity instanciated by a connector. It may be composed of
multiple stages linked together. Generally it is the part of the stream
interface holding a file descriptor, but it can also be a processing block or a
transformation block terminated by a connection. A connection presents a
server-side interface.


2) Sequencing
-------------

Upon startup, listeners are instanciated by the configuration. When an incoming
connection reaches a listening file descriptor, its read() callback calls the
corresponding listener's accept() function which instanciates an initiator and
in turn recursively calls upper layers' accept() callbacks until
accept_session() is called. accept_session() instanciates a new session which
starts protocol analysis via process_session(). When all protocol analysis is
done, process_session() calls the connect() callback of the connector in order
to get a connection.
