ABSTRACT
--------

The filters support is a new feature of HAProxy 1.7. It is a way to extend
HAProxy without touching its core code and, in certain extent, without knowing
its internals. This feature will ease contributions, reducing impact of
changes. Another advantage will be to simplify HAProxy by replacing some parts
by filters. As we will see, and as an example, the HTTP compression is the first
feature moved in a filter.

This document describes how to write a filter and what to keep in mind to do
so. It also talks about the known limits and the pitfalls to avoid.

As said, filters are quite new for now. The API is not freezed and will be
updated/modified/improved/extended as needed.

1. FILTERS INTRODUCTION
-----------------------

First of all, to fully understand how filters work and how to create one, it is
best to know, at least from a distance, what is a proxy (frontend/backend), a
stream and a channel in HAProxy and how these entities are linked to each other.
In doc/internals/api/layers.txt is a good overview of the different layers in
HAProxy and in doc/internals/muxes.pdf is described the flow between the
different muxes.

Then, to support filters, many callbacks has been added to HAProxy at different
places, mainly around channel analyzers. Their purpose is to allow filters to
be involved in the data processing, from the stream creation/destruction to
the data forwarding. Depending of what it should do, a filter can implement all
or part of these callbacks. For now, existing callbacks are focused on
streams. But future improvements could enlarge filters scope. For instance, it
could be useful to handle events at the connection level.

In HAProxy configuration file, a filter is declared in a proxy section, except
default. So the configuration corresponding to a filter declaration is attached
to a specific proxy, and will be shared by all its instances. it is opaque from
the HAProxy point of view, this is the filter responsibility to manage it. For
each filter declaration matches a uniq configuration. Several declarations of
the same filter in the same proxy will be handle as different filters by
HAProxy.

A filter instance is represented by a partially opaque context (or a state)
attached to a stream and passed as arguments to callbacks. Through this context,
filter instances are stateful. Depending the filter is declared in a frontend or
a backend section, its instances will be created, respectively, when a stream is
created or when a backend is selected. Their behaviors will also be
different. Only instances of filters declared in a frontend section will be
aware of the creation and the destruction of the stream, and will take part in
the channels analyzing before the backend is defined.

It is important to remember the configuration of a filter is shared by all its
instances, while the context of an instance is owned by a uniq stream.

Filters are designed to be chained. It is possible to declare several filters in
the same proxy section. The declaration order is important because filters will
be called one after the other respecting this order. Frontend and backend
filters are also chained, frontend ones called first. Even if the filters
processing is serialized, each filter will bahave as it was alone (unless it was
developed to be aware of other filters). For all that, some constraints are
imposed to filters, especially when data exchanged between the client and the
server are processed. We will discuss again these constraints when we will tackle
the subject of writing a filter.



2. HOW TO USE FILTERS
---------------------

To use a filter, the parameter 'filter' should be used, followed by the filter
name and, optionally, its configuration in the desired listen, frontend or
backend section. For instance :

    listen test
        ...
        filter trace name TST
        ...


See doc/configuration.txt for a formal definition of the parameter 'filter'.
Note that additional parameters on the filter line must be parsed by the filter
itself.

The list of available filters is reported by 'haproxy -vv' :

    $> haproxy -vv
    HAProxy version 1.7-dev2-3a1d4a-33 2016/03/21
    Copyright 2000-2016 Willy Tarreau <willy@haproxy.org>

    [...]

    Available filters :
            [COMP] compression
            [TRACE] trace


Multiple filter lines can be used in a proxy section to chain filters. Filters
will be called in the declaration order.

Some filters can support implicit declarations in certain circumstances
(without the filter line). This is not recommended for new features but are
useful for existing ones moved in a filter, for backward compatibility
reasons. Implicit declarations are supported when there is only one filter used
on a proxy. When several filters are used, explicit declarations are mandatory.
The HTTP compression filter is one of these filters. Alone, using 'compression'
keywords is enough to use it. But when at least a second filter is used, a
filter line must be added.

    # filter line is optional
    listen t1
        bind *:80
        compression algo gzip
        compression offload
        server srv x.x.x.x:80

    # filter line is mandatory for the compression filter
    listen t2
        bind *:81
        filter trace name T2
        filter compression
        compression algo gzip
        compression offload
        server srv x.x.x.x:80




3. HOW TO WRITE A NEW FILTER
----------------------------

To write a filter, there are 2 header files to explore :

  * include/haproxy/filters-t.h : This is the main header file, containing all
                                  important structures to use. It represents the
                                  filter API.

  * include/haproxy/filters.h : This header file contains helper functions that
                                may be used. It also contains the internal API
                                used by HAProxy to handle filters.

To ease the filters integration, it is better to follow some conventions :

  * Use 'flt_' prefix to name the filter (e.g flt_http_comp or flt_trace).

  * Keep everything related to the filter in a same file.

The filter 'trace' can be used as a template to write new filter. It is a good
start to see how filters really work.

3.1 API OVERVIEW
----------------

Writing a filter can be summarized to write functions and attach them to the
existing callbacks. Available callbacks are listed in the following structure :

    struct flt_ops {
        /*
         * Callbacks to manage the filter lifecycle
         */
        int  (*init)             (struct proxy *p, struct flt_conf *fconf);
        void (*deinit)           (struct proxy *p, struct flt_conf *fconf);
        int  (*check)            (struct proxy *p, struct flt_conf *fconf);
        int  (*init_per_thread)  (struct proxy *p, struct flt_conf *fconf);
        void (*deinit_per_thread)(struct proxy *p, struct flt_conf *fconf);

        /*
         * Stream callbacks
         */
        int  (*attach)            (struct stream *s, struct filter *f);
        int  (*stream_start)      (struct stream *s, struct filter *f);
        int  (*stream_set_backend)(struct stream *s, struct filter *f, struct proxy *be);
        void (*stream_stop)       (struct stream *s, struct filter *f);
        void (*detach)            (struct stream *s, struct filter *f);
        void (*check_timeouts)    (struct stream *s, struct filter *f);

        /*
         * Channel callbacks
         */
        int  (*channel_start_analyze)(struct stream *s, struct filter *f,
                                      struct channel *chn);
        int  (*channel_pre_analyze)  (struct stream *s, struct filter *f,
                                      struct channel *chn,
                                      unsigned int an_bit);
        int  (*channel_post_analyze) (struct stream *s, struct filter *f,
                                      struct channel *chn,
                                      unsigned int an_bit);
        int  (*channel_end_analyze)  (struct stream *s, struct filter *f,
                                      struct channel *chn);

        /*
         * HTTP callbacks
         */
        int  (*http_headers)       (struct stream *s, struct filter *f,
                                    struct http_msg *msg);
        int  (*http_payload)       (struct stream *s, struct filter *f,
                                    struct http_msg *msg, unsigned int offset,
                                    unsigned int len);
        int  (*http_end)           (struct stream *s, struct filter *f,
                                    struct http_msg *msg);

        void (*http_reset)         (struct stream *s, struct filter *f,
                                    struct http_msg *msg);
        void (*http_reply)         (struct stream *s, struct filter *f,
                                    short status,
                                    const struct buffer *msg);

        /*
         * TCP callbacks
         */
        int  (*tcp_payload)     (struct stream *s, struct filter *f,
                                 struct channel *chn, unsigned int offset,
                                 unsigned int len);
    };


We will explain in following parts when these callbacks are called and what they
should do.

Filters are declared in proxy sections. So each proxy have an ordered list of
filters, possibly empty if no filter is used. When the configuration of a proxy
is parsed, each filter line represents an entry in this list. In the structure
'proxy', the filters configurations are stored in the field 'filter_configs',
each one of type 'struct flt_conf *' :

    /*
     * Structure representing the filter configuration, attached to a proxy and
     * accessible from a filter when instantiated in a stream
     */
    struct flt_conf {
        const char     *id;   /* The filter id */
        struct flt_ops *ops;  /* The filter callbacks */
        void           *conf; /* The filter configuration */
        struct list     list; /* Next filter for the same proxy */
        unsigned int    flags; /* FLT_CFG_FL_* */
    };

  * 'flt_conf.id' is an identifier, defined by the filter. It can be
    NULL. HAProxy does not use this field. Filters can use it in log messages or
    as a uniq identifier to check multiple declarations. It is the filter
    responsibility to free it, if necessary.

  * 'flt_conf.conf' is opaque. It is the internal configuration of a filter,
    generally allocated and filled by its parsing function (See § 3.2). It is
    the filter responsibility to free it.

  * 'flt_conf.ops' references the callbacks implemented by the filter. This
    field must be set during the parsing phase (See § 3.2) and can be refine
    during the initialization phase (See § 3.3). If it is dynamically allocated,
    it is the filter responsibility to free it.

  * 'flt_conf.flags' is a bitfield to specify the filter capabilities. For now,
    only FLT_CFG_FL_HTX may be set when a filter is able to process HTX
    streams. If not set, the filter is excluded from the HTTP filtering.


The filter configuration is global and shared by all its instances. A filter
instance is created in the context of a stream and attached to this stream. in
the structure 'stream', the field 'strm_flt' is the state of all filter
instances attached to a stream :

    /*
     * Structure representing the "global" state of filters attached to a
     * stream.
     */
    struct strm_flt {
        struct list    filters;             /* List of filters attached to a stream */
        struct filter *current[2];          /* From which filter resume processing, for a specific channel.
                                             * This is used for resumable callbacks only,
                                             * If NULL, we start from the first filter.
                                             * 0: request channel, 1: response channel */
        unsigned short flags;               /* STRM_FL_* */
        unsigned char  nb_req_data_filters; /* Number of data filters registered on the request channel */
        unsigned char  nb_rsp_data_filters; /* Number of data filters registered on the response channel */
        unsigned long long offset[2];       /* gloal offset of input data already filtered for a specific channel
                                             * 0: request channel, 1: response channel */
    };


Filter instances attached to a stream are stored in the field
'strm_flt.filters', each instance is of type 'struct filter *' :

    /*
     * Structure representing a filter instance attached to a stream
     *
     * 2D-Array fields are used to store info per channel. The first index
     * stands for the request channel, and the second one for the response
     * channel.  Especially, <next> and <fwd> are offsets representing amount of
     * data that the filter are, respectively, parsed and forwarded on a
     * channel. Filters can access these values using FLT_NXT and FLT_FWD
     * macros.
     */
    struct filter {
        struct flt_conf *config; /* the filter's configuration */
        void           *ctx;     /* The filter context (opaque) */
        unsigned short  flags;   /* FLT_FL_* */
        unsigned long long offset[2];   /* Offset of input data already filtered for a specific channel
                                         * 0: request channel, 1: response channel */
        unsigned int    pre_analyzers;  /* bit field indicating analyzers to
                                         * pre-process */
        unsigned int    post_analyzers; /* bit field indicating analyzers to
                                         * post-process */
        struct list     list;    /* Next filter for the same proxy/stream */
    };

  * 'filter.config' is the filter configuration previously described. All
    instances of a filter share it.

  * 'filter.ctx' is an opaque context. It is managed by the filter, so it is its
    responsibility to free it.

  * 'filter.pre_analyzers and 'filter.post_analyzers will be described later
    (See § 3.5).

  * 'filter.offset' will be described later (See § 3.6).


3.2. DEFINING THE FILTER NAME AND ITS CONFIGURATION
---------------------------------------------------

During the filter development, the first thing to do is to add it in the
supported filters. To do so, its name must be registered as a valid keyword on
the filter line :

    /* Declare the filter parser for "my_filter" keyword */
    static struct flt_kw_list flt_kws = { "MY_FILTER_SCOPE", { }, {
            { "my_filter", parse_my_filter_cfg, NULL /* private data */ },
            { NULL, NULL, NULL },
        }
    };
    INITCALL1(STG_REGISTER, flt_register_keywords, &flt_kws);


Then the filter internal configuration must be defined. For instance :

    struct my_filter_config {
        struct proxy *proxy;
        char         *name;
        /* ... */
    };


All callbacks implemented by the filter must then be declared. Here, a global
variable is used :

    struct flt_ops my_filter_ops {
        .init   = my_filter_init,
        .deinit = my_filter_deinit,
        .check  = my_filter_config_check,

        /* ... */
     };


Finally, the function to parse the filter configuration must be written, here
'parse_my_filter_cfg'. This function must parse all remaining keywords on the
filter line :

    /* Return -1 on error, else 0 */
    static int
    parse_my_filter_cfg(char **args, int *cur_arg, struct proxy *px,
                        struct flt_conf *flt_conf, char **err, void *private)
    {
        struct my_filter_config *my_conf;
        int pos = *cur_arg;

        /* Allocate the internal configuration used by the filter */
        my_conf = calloc(1, sizeof(*my_conf));
        if (!my_conf) {
            memprintf(err, "%s : out of memory", args[*cur_arg]);
            return -1;
        }
        my_conf->proxy = px;

        /* ... */

        /* Parse all keywords supported by the filter and fill the internal
         * configuration */
        pos++; /* Skip the filter name */
        while (*args[pos]) {
            if (!strcmp(args[pos], "name")) {
                if (!*args[pos + 1]) {
                    memprintf(err, "'%s' : '%s' option without value",
                              args[*cur_arg], args[pos]);
                              goto error;
                }
                my_conf->name = strdup(args[pos + 1]);
                if (!my_conf->name) {
                    memprintf(err, "%s : out of memory", args[*cur_arg]);
                    goto error;
                }
                pos += 2;
            }

            /* ... parse other keywords ... */
        }
        *cur_arg = pos;

        /* Set callbacks supported by the filter */
        flt_conf->ops  = &my_filter_ops;

        /* Last, save the internal configuration */
        flt_conf->conf = my_conf;
        return 0;

      error:
         if (my_conf->name)
            free(my_conf->name);
        free(my_conf);
        return -1;
    }


WARNING : In this parsing function, 'flt_conf->ops' must be initialized. All
          arguments of the filter line must also be parsed. This is mandatory.

In the previous example, the filter lne should be read as follows :

    filter my_filter name MY_NAME ...


Optionally, by implementing the 'flt_ops.check' callback, an extra set is added
to check the internal configuration of the filter after the parsing phase, when
the HAProxy configuration is fully defined. For instance :

    /* Check configuration of a trace filter for a specified proxy.
     * Return 1 on error, else 0. */
    static int
    my_filter_config_check(struct proxy *px, struct flt_conf *my_conf)
    {
        if (px->mode != PR_MODE_HTTP) {
            Alert("The filter 'my_filter' cannot be used in non-HTTP mode.\n");
            return 1;
        }

        /* ... */

        return 0;
    }



3.3. MANAGING THE FILTER LIFECYCLE
----------------------------------

Once the configuration parsed and checked, filters are ready to by used. There
are two main callbacks to manage the filter lifecycle :

  * 'flt_ops.init' : It initializes the filter for a proxy. This callback may be
                     defined to finish the filter configuration.

  * 'flt_ops.deinit' : It cleans up what the parsing function and the init
                       callback have done. This callback is useful to release
                       memory allocated for the filter configuration.

Here is an example :

    /* Initialize the filter. Returns -1 on error, else 0. */
    static int
    my_filter_init(struct proxy *px, struct flt_conf *fconf)
    {
        struct my_filter_config *my_conf = fconf->conf;

        /* ... */

        return 0;
    }

    /* Free resources allocated by the trace filter. */
    static void
    my_filter_deinit(struct proxy *px, struct flt_conf *fconf)
    {
        struct my_filter_config *my_conf = fconf->conf;

        if (my_conf) {
            free(my_conf->name);
            /* ... */
            free(my_conf);
        }
        fconf->conf = NULL;
    }


3.3.1 DEALING WITH THREADS
--------------------------

When HAProxy is compiled with the threads support and started with more that one
thread (global.nbthread > 1), then it is possible to manage the filter per
thread with following callbacks :

  * 'flt_ops.init_per_thread': It initializes the filter for each thread. It
                               works the same way than 'flt_ops.init' but in the
                               context of a thread. This callback is called
                               after the thread creation.

  * 'flt_ops.deinit_per_thread': It cleans up what the init_per_thread callback
                                 have done. It is called in the context of a
                                 thread, before exiting it.

It is the filter responsibility to deal with concurrency. check, init and deinit
callbacks are called on the main thread. All others are called on a "worker"
thread (not always the same). It is also the filter responsibility to know if
HAProxy is started with more than one thread. If it is started with one thread
(or compiled without the threads support), these callbacks will be silently
ignored (in this case, global.nbthread will be always equal to one).


3.4. HANDLING THE STREAMS ACTIVITY
-----------------------------------

It may be interesting to handle streams activity. For now, there is three
callbacks that should define to do so :

  * 'flt_ops.stream_start' : It is called when a stream is started. This
                             callback can fail by returning a negative value. It
                             will be considered as a critical error by HAProxy
                             which disabled the listener for a short time.

  * 'flt_ops.stream_set_backend' : It is called when a backend is set for a
                                   stream. This callbacks will be called for all
                                   filters attached to a stream (frontend and
                                   backend). Note this callback is not called if
                                   the frontend and the backend are the same.

  * 'flt_ops.stream_stop' : It is called when a stream is stopped. This callback
                            always succeed. Anyway, it is too late to return an
                            error.

For instance :

    /* Called when a stream is created. Returns -1 on error, else 0. */
    static int
    my_filter_stream_start(struct stream *s, struct filter *filter)
    {
         struct my_filter_config *my_conf = FLT_CONF(filter);

         /* ... */

         return 0;
    }

    /* Called when a backend is set for a stream */
    static int
    my_filter_stream_set_backend(struct stream *s, struct filter *filter,
                                 struct proxy *be)
    {
         struct my_filter_config *my_conf = FLT_CONF(filter);

        /* ... */

        return 0;
    }

    /* Called when a stream is destroyed */
    static void
    my_filter_stream_stop(struct stream *s, struct filter *filter)
    {
        struct my_filter_config *my_conf = FLT_CONF(filter);

         /* ... */
    }


WARNING : Handling the streams creation and destruction is only possible for
          filters defined on proxies with the frontend capability.

In addition, it is possible to handle creation and destruction of filter
instances using following callbacks:

  * 'flt_ops.attach' : It is called after a filter instance creation, when it is
                       attached to a stream. This happens when the stream is
                       started for filters defined on the stream's frontend and
                       when the backend is set for filters declared on the
                       stream's backend. It is possible to ignore the filter, if
                       needed, by returning 0. This could be useful to have
                       conditional filtering.

  * 'flt_ops.detach' : It is called when a filter instance is detached from a
                       stream, before its destruction. This happens when the
                       stream is stopped for filters defined on the stream's
                       frontend and when the analyze ends for filters defined on
                       the stream's backend.

For instance :

    /* Called when a filter instance is created and attach to a stream */
    static int
    my_filter_attach(struct stream *s, struct filter *filter)
    {
        struct my_filter_config *my_conf = FLT_CONF(filter);

        if (/* ... */)
            return 0; /* Ignore the filter here */
        return 1;
    }

    /* Called when a filter instance is detach from a stream, just before its
     * destruction */
    static void
    my_filter_detach(struct stream *s, struct filter *filter)
    {
        struct my_filter_config *my_conf = FLT_CONF(filter);

        /* ... */
    }

Finally, it may be interesting to notify the filter when the stream is woken up
because of an expired timer. This could let a chance to check some internal
timeouts, if any. To do so the following callback must be used :

  * 'flt_opt.check_timeouts' : It is called when a stream is woken up because of
                               an expired timer.

For instance :

    /* Called when a stream is woken up because of an expired timer */
    static void
    my_filter_check_timeouts(struct stream *s, struct filter *filter)
    {
        struct my_filter_config *my_conf = FLT_CONF(filter);

        /* ... */
    }


3.5. ANALYZING THE CHANNELS ACTIVITY
------------------------------------

The main purpose of filters is to take part in the channels analyzing. To do so,
there is 2 callbacks, 'flt_ops.channel_pre_analyze' and
'flt_ops.channel_post_analyze', called respectively before and after each
analyzer attached to a channel, except analyzers responsible for the data
forwarding (TCP or HTTP). Concretely, on the request channel, these callbacks
could be called before following analyzers :

  * tcp_inspect_request        (AN_REQ_INSPECT_FE and AN_REQ_INSPECT_BE)
  * http_wait_for_request      (AN_REQ_WAIT_HTTP)
  * http_wait_for_request_body (AN_REQ_HTTP_BODY)
  * http_process_req_common    (AN_REQ_HTTP_PROCESS_FE)
  * process_switching_rules    (AN_REQ_SWITCHING_RULES)
  * http_process_req_ common   (AN_REQ_HTTP_PROCESS_BE)
  * http_process_tarpit        (AN_REQ_HTTP_TARPIT)
  * process_server_rules       (AN_REQ_SRV_RULES)
  * http_process_request       (AN_REQ_HTTP_INNER)
  * tcp_persist_rdp_cookie     (AN_REQ_PRST_RDP_COOKIE)
  * process_sticking_rules     (AN_REQ_STICKING_RULES)

And on the response channel :

  * tcp_inspect_response     (AN_RES_INSPECT)
  * http_wait_for_response   (AN_RES_WAIT_HTTP)
  * process_store_rules      (AN_RES_STORE_RULES)
  * http_process_res_common  (AN_RES_HTTP_PROCESS_BE)

Unlike the other callbacks previously seen before, 'flt_ops.channel_pre_analyze'
can interrupt the stream processing. So a filter can decide to not execute the
analyzer that follows and wait the next iteration. If there are more than one
filter, following ones are skipped. On the next iteration, the filtering resumes
where it was stopped, i.e. on the filter that has previously stopped the
processing. So it is possible for a filter to stop the stream processing on a
specific analyzer for a while before continuing. Moreover, this callback can be
called many times for the same analyzer, until it finishes its processing. For
instance :

    /* Called before a processing happens on a given channel.
     * Returns a negative value if an error occurs, 0 if it needs to wait,
     * any other value otherwise. */
    static int
    my_filter_chn_pre_analyze(struct stream *s, struct filter *filter,
                              struct channel *chn, unsigned an_bit)
    {
        struct my_filter_config *my_conf = FLT_CONF(filter);

        switch (an_bit) {
            case AN_REQ_WAIT_HTTP:
                if (/* wait that a condition is verified before continuing */)
                    return 0;
                break;
            /* ... * /
        }
        return 1;
    }

  * 'an_bit' is the analyzer id. All analyzers are listed in
    'include/haproxy/channels-t.h'.

  * 'chn' is the channel on which the analyzing is done. It is possible to
    determine if it is the request or the response channel by testing if
    CF_ISRESP flag is set :

      │ ((chn->flags & CF_ISRESP) == CF_ISRESP)


In previous example, the stream processing is blocked before receipt of the HTTP
request until a condition is verified.

'flt_ops.channel_post_analyze', for its part, is not resumable. It returns a
negative value if an error occurs, any other value otherwise. It is called when
a filterable analyzer finishes its processing, so once for the same analyzer.
For instance :

    /* Called after a processing happens on a given channel.
     * Returns a negative value if an error occurs, any other
     * value otherwise. */
    static int
    my_filter_chn_post_analyze(struct stream *s, struct filter *filter,
                               struct channel *chn, unsigned an_bit)
    {
        struct my_filter_config *my_conf = FLT_CONF(filter);
        struct http_msg         *msg;

        switch (an_bit) {
            case AN_REQ_WAIT_HTTP:
                if (/* A test on received headers before any other treatment */) {
                    msg = ((chn->flags & CF_ISRESP) ? &s->txn->rsp : &s->txn->req);
                    txn->status = 400;
                    msg->msg_state = HTTP_MSG_ERROR;
                    http_reply_and_close(s, s->txn->status, http_error_message(s));
                    return -1; /* This is an error ! */
                }
                break;
            /* ... * /
        }
        return 1;
    }


Pre and post analyzer callbacks of a filter are not automatically called. They
must be regiesterd explicitly on analyzers, updating the value of
'filter.pre_analyzers' and 'filter.post_analyzers' bit fields. All analyzer bits
are listed in 'include/types/channels.h'. Here is an example :

    static int
    my_filter_stream_start(struct stream *s, struct filter *filter)
    {
        /* ... * /

        /* Register the pre analyzer callback on all request and response
         * analyzers */
        filter->pre_analyzers |= (AN_REQ_ALL | AN_RES_ALL)

        /* Register the post analyzer callback of only on AN_REQ_WAIT_HTTP and
         * AN_RES_WAIT_HTTP analyzers */
         filter->post_analyzers |= (AN_REQ_WAIT_HTTP | AN_RES_WAIT_HTTP)

        /* ... * /
        return 0;
    }


To surround activity of a filter during the channel analyzing, two new analyzers
has been added :

  * 'flt_start_analyze' (AN_REQ/RES_FLT_START_FE/AN_REQ_RES_FLT_START_BE) : For
    a specific filter, this analyzer is called before any call to the
    'channel_analyze' callback. From the filter point of view, it calls the
    'flt_ops.channel_start_analyze' callback.

  * 'flt_end_analyze' (AN_REQ/RES_FLT_END) : For a specific filter, this
    analyzer is called when all other analyzers have finished their
    processing. From the filter point of view, it calls the
    'flt_ops.channel_end_analyze' callback.

These analyzers are called only once per streams.

'flt_ops.channel_start_analyze' and 'flt_ops.channel_end_analyze' callbacks can
interrupt the stream processing, as 'flt_ops.channel_analyze'. Here is an
example :

    /* Called when analyze starts for a given channel
     * Returns a negative value if an error occurs, 0 if it needs to wait,
     * any other value otherwise. */
    static int
    my_filter_chn_start_analyze(struct stream *s, struct filter *filter,
                                struct channel *chn)
    {
        struct my_filter_config *my_conf = FLT_CONF(filter);

        /* ... TODO ... */

        return 1;
    }

    /* Called when analyze ends for a given channel
     * Returns a negative value if an error occurs, 0 if it needs to wait,
     * any other value otherwise. */
    static int
    my_filter_chn_end_analyze(struct stream *s, struct filter *filter,
                              struct channel *chn)
    {
        struct my_filter_config *my_conf = FLT_CONF(filter);

        /* ... TODO ... */

        return 1;
    }


Workflow on channels can be summarized as following :

   FE: Called for filters defined on the stream's frontend
   BE: Called for filters defined on the stream's backend

 3.6. FILTERING THE DATA EXCHANGED
-----------------------------------

WARNING : To fully understand this part, it is important to be aware on how the
          buffers work in HAProxy. For the HTTP part, it is also important to
          understand how data are parsed and structured, and how the internal
          representation, called HTX, works. See doc/internals/buffer-api.txt
          and doc/internals/htx-api.txt for details.

An extended feature of the filters is the data filtering. By default a filter
does not look into data exchanged between the client and the server because it
is expensive. Indeed, instead of forwarding data without any processing, each
byte need to be buffered.

So, to enable the data filtering on a channel, at any time, in one of previous
callbacks, 'register_data_filter' function must be called. And conversely, to
disable it, 'unregister_data_filter' function must be called. For instance :

    my_filter_http_headers(struct stream *s, struct filter *filter,
                           struct http_msg *msg)
    {
        struct my_filter_config *my_conf = FLT_CONF(filter);

        /* 'chn' must be the request channel */
        if (!(msg->chn->flags & CF_ISRESP)) {
            struct htx *htx;
            struct ist hdr;
            struct http_hdr_ctx ctx;

            htx = htxbuf(msg->chn->buf);

            /* Enable the data filtering for the request if 'X-Filter' header
             * is set to 'true'. */
            hdr = ist("X-Filter);
            ctx.blk = NULL;
            if (http_find_header(htx, hdr, &ctx, 0) &&
                ctx.value.len >= 4 && memcmp(ctx.value.ptr, "true", 4) == 0)
                register_data_filter(s, chn, filter);
        }

        return 1;
    }

Here, the data filtering is enabled if the HTTP header 'X-Filter' is found and
set to 'true'.

If several filters are declared, the evaluation order remains the same,
regardless the order of the registrations to the data filtering. Data
registrations must be performed before the data forwarding step. However, a
filter may be unregistered from the data filtering at any time.

Depending on the stream type, TCP or HTTP, the way to handle data filtering is
different. HTTP data are structured while TCP data are raw. And there are more
callbacks for HTTP streams to fully handle all steps of an HTTP transaction. But
the main part is the same. The data filtering is performed in one callback,
called in loop on input data starting at a specific offset for a given
length. Data analyzed by a filter are considered as forwarded from its point of
view. Because filters are chained, a filter never analyzes more data than its
predecessors. Thus only data analyzed by the last filter are effectively
forwarded. This means, at any time, any filter may choose to not analyze all
available data (available from its point of view), blocking the data forwarding.

Internally, filters own 2 offsets representing the number of bytes already
analyzed in the available input data, one per channel. There is also an offset
couple at the stream level, in the strm_flt object, representing the total
number of bytes already forwarded. These offsets may be retrieved and updated
using following macros :

  * FLT_OFF(flt, chn)

  * FLT_STRM_OFF(s, chn)

where 'flt' is the 'struct filter' passed as argument in all callbacks, 's' the
filtered stream and 'chn' is the considered channel. However, there is no reason
for a filter to use these macros or take care of these offsets.


3.6.1 FILTERING DATA ON TCP STREAMS
-----------------------------------

The TCP data filtering for TCP streams is the easy case, because HAProxy do not
parse these data. Data are stored in raw in the buffer. So there is only one
callback to consider:

  * 'flt_ops.tcp_payload : This callback is called when input data are
    available. If not defined, all available data will be considered as analyzed
    and forwarded from the filter point of view.

This callback is called only if the filter is registered to analyze TCP
data. Here is an example :

    /* Returns a negative value if an error occurs, else the number of
     * consumed bytes. */
    static int
    my_filter_tcp_payload(struct stream *s, struct filter *filter,
                          struct channel *chn, unsigned int offset,
                          unsigned int len)
    {
        struct my_filter_config *my_conf = FLT_CONF(filter);
        int ret = len;

        /* Do not parse more than 'my_conf->max_parse' bytes at a time */
        if (my_conf->max_parse != 0 && ret > my_conf->max_parse)
            ret = my_conf->max_parse;

        /* if available data are not completely parsed, wake up the stream to
         * be sure to not freeze it. The best is probably to set a
         * chn->analyse_exp timer */
        if (ret != len)
            task_wakeup(s->task, TASK_WOKEN_MSG);
        return ret;
    }

But it is important to note that tunnelled data of an HTTP stream may also be
filtered via this callback. Tunnelled data are data exchange after an HTTP tunnel
is established between the client and the server, via an HTTP CONNECT or via a
protocol upgrade. In this case, the data are structured. Of course, to do so,
the filter must be able to parse HTX data and must have the FLT_CFG_FL_HTX flag
set. At any time, the IS_HTX_STRM() macros may be used on the stream to know if
it is an HTX stream or a TCP stream.


3.6.2 FILTERING DATA ON HTTP STREAMS
------------------------------------

The HTTP data filtering is a bit more complex because HAProxy data are
structutred and represented to an internal format, called HTX. So basically
there is the HTTP counterpart to the previous callback :

  * 'flt_ops.http_payload' : This callback is called when input data are
    available. If not defined, all available data will be considered as analyzed
    and forwarded for the filter.

But the prototype for this callbacks is slightly different. Instead of having
the channel as parameter, we have the HTTP message (struct http_msg). This
callback is called only if the filter is registered to analyze TCP data. Here is
an example :

    /* Returns a negative value if an error occurs, else the number of
     * consumed bytes. */
    static int
    my_filter_http_payload(struct stream *s, struct filter *filter,
                           struct http_msg *msg, unsigned int offset,
                           unsigned int len)
    {
        struct my_filter_config *my_conf = FLT_CONF(filter);
        struct htx *htx = htxbuf(&msg->chn->buf);
        struct htx_ret htxret = htx_find_offset(htx, offset);
        struct htx_blk *blk;

        blk = htxret.blk;
        offset = htxret.ret;
        for (; blk; blk = htx_get_next_blk(blk, htx)) {
            enum htx_blk_type type = htx_get_blk_type(blk);

            if (type == HTX_BLK_UNUSED)
                continue;
            else if (type == HTX_BLK_DATA) {
                /* filter data */
            }
            else
                break;
        }

        return len;
    }

In addition, there are two others callbacks :

  * 'flt_ops.http_headers' : This callback is called just before the HTTP body
    forwarding and after any processing on the request/response HTTP
    headers. When defined, this callback is always called for HTTP streams
    (i.e. without needs of a registration on data filtering).
    Here is an example :


        /* Returns a negative value if an error occurs, 0 if it needs to wait,
         * any other value otherwise. */
         static int
         my_filter_http_headers(struct stream *s, struct filter *filter,
                                struct http_msg *msg)
        {
            struct my_filter_config *my_conf = FLT_CONF(filter);
            struct htx *htx = htxbuf(&msg->chn->buf);
            struct htx_sl *sl = http_get_stline(htx);
            int32_t pos;

            for (pos = htx_get_first(htx); pos != -1; pos = htx_get_next(htx, pos)) {
                struct htx_blk *blk = htx_get_blk(htx, pos);
                enum htx_blk_type type = htx_get_blk_type(blk);
                struct ist n, v;

                if (type == HTX_BLK_EOH)
                        break;
                if (type != HTX_BLK_HDR)
                        continue;

                n = htx_get_blk_name(htx, blk);
                v = htx_get_blk_value(htx, blk);
		/* Do something on the header name/value */
            }

            return 1;
        }

  * 'flt_ops.http_end' : This callback is called when the whole HTTP message was
    processed. It may interrupt the stream processing. So, it could be used to
    synchronize the HTTP request with the HTTP response, for instance :

        /* Returns a negative value if an error occurs, 0 if it needs to wait,
         * any other value otherwise. */
         static int
         my_filter_http_end(struct stream *s, struct filter *filter,
                            struct http_msg *msg)
         {
             struct my_filter_ctx *my_ctx = filter->ctx;


            if (!(msg->chn->flags & CF_ISRESP)) /* The request */
                my_ctx->end_of_req = 1;
            else /* The response */
                my_ctx->end_of_rsp = 1;

            /* Both the request and the response are finished */
            if (my_ctx->end_of_req == 1 && my_ctx->end_of_rsp == 1)
                return 1;

            /* Wait */
            return 0;
        }

Then, to finish, there are 2 informational callbacks :

  * 'flt_ops.http_reset' : This callback is called when an HTTP message is
    reset. This happens either when a 1xx informational response is received, or
    if we're retrying to send the request to the server after it failed. It
    could be useful to reset the filter context before receiving the true
    response.
    By checking s->txn->status, it is possible to know why this callback is
    called. If it's a 1xx, we're called because of an informational
    message. Otherwise, it is a L7 retry.

  * 'flt_ops.http_reply' : This callback is called when, at any time, HAProxy
    decides to stop the processing on a HTTP message and to send an internal
    response to the client. This mainly happens when an error or a redirect
    occurs.


3.6.3 REWRITING DATA
--------------------

The last part, and the trickiest one about the data filtering, is about the data
rewriting. For now, the filter API does not offer a lot of functions to handle
it. There are only functions to notify HAProxy that the data size has changed to
let it update internal state of filters. This is the developer responsibility to
update data itself, i.e. the buffer offsets, using following function :

  * 'flt_update_offsets()' : This function must be called when a filter alter
    incoming data. It updates offsets of the stream and of all filters
    preceding the calling one. Do not call this function when a filter change
    the size of incoming data leads to an undefined behavior.

A good example of filter changing the data size is the HTTP compression filter.
