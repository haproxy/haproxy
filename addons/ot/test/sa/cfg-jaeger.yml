###
# When using configuration object to instantiate the tracer, the type of
# sampling can be selected via sampler.type and sampler.param properties.
# Jaeger libraries support the following samplers:
#
#  - Constant (sampler.type=const) sampler always makes the same decision for
#    all traces.  It either samples all traces (sampler.param=1) or none of
#    them (sampler.param=0).
#
#  - Probabilistic (sampler.type=probabilistic) sampler makes a random sampling
#    decision with the probability of sampling equal to the value of
#    sampler.param property.  For example, with sampler.param=0.1 approximately
#    1 in 10 traces will be sampled.
#
#  - Rate Limiting (sampler.type=ratelimiting) sampler uses a leaky bucket rate
#    limiter to ensure that traces are sampled with a certain constant rate.
#    For example, when sampler.param=2.0 it will sample requests with the rate
#    of 2 traces per second.
#
#  - Remote (sampler.type=remote, which is also the default) sampler consults
#    Jaeger agent for the appropriate sampling strategy to use in the current
#    service.  This allows controlling the sampling strategies in the services
#    from a central configuration in Jaeger backend, or even dynamically.
